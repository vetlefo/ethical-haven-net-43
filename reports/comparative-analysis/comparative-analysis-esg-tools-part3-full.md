**Introduction: The Growing Importance of ESG Reporting**

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have moved from the periphery to the core of business strategy and operations. This shift is propelled by a confluence of drivers, including increasing regulatory mandates, heightened investor interest in sustainable practices, and growing expectations from a wide range of stakeholders, such as customers, employees, and communities. Regulatory bodies worldwide are implementing more stringent requirements for ESG disclosure, pushing companies to formalize their reporting processes 1. Investors are increasingly using ESG performance as a key indicator of long-term value and risk, allocating capital towards companies demonstrating strong sustainability credentials 2. Furthermore, stakeholders are demanding greater transparency and accountability from organizations regarding their environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices 2.

In this evolving landscape, ESG reporting tools play a vital role in enabling organizations to effectively collect, manage, analyze, and disclose their ESG performance data. These tools help streamline complex processes, ensure data accuracy, facilitate compliance with diverse reporting frameworks, and ultimately enhance transparency and build trust with stakeholders 5. This report undertakes a comparative analysis of seven ESG reporting tools as initially requested by the user. However, due to the availability of research material, the in-depth analysis will focus on four of these platforms: ETQ Reliance QMS, Workday Adaptive Planning, IRIS CARBON®, and osapiens. The report will examine the key features and functionalities each tool offers for ESG reporting, their pricing models and subscription plans, and relevant user reviews and testimonials to provide a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and market perception.

**ETQ Reliance QMS: An In-Depth Analysis**

ETQ Reliance QMS is a cloud-native quality management system designed to streamline quality processes and ensure compliance with industry standards 7. While primarily a QMS, it offers a suite of applications that extend to areas crucial for ESG reporting, particularly in environmental management, health and safety, and risk management 8.

**Key Features and Functionalities for ESG Reporting**

The platform's broad application portfolio includes several modules directly relevant to ESG. Its Environmental Management application allows organizations to identify environmental risk targets, log permit information, and track sustainability initiatives 9. This module includes features for creating, maintaining, and monitoring environmental, social, and economic aspects, objectives, and targets, enabling the gathering of quantifiable information about environmental impact and the generation of aspect documents over time 11. The system also supports permit control, allowing for the creation and storage of permits with necessary regulatory information, tracking limits, and reporting permit types by location 11. This functionality helps minimize an organization's carbon footprint by providing a single source of truth for sustainability initiatives and tracking progress 11.

ETQ Reliance QMS also addresses the social aspect of ESG through its Health & Safety applications. These include features for safety management, risk assessment, and incident reporting 7. The Job Safety Analysis (JSA) module helps identify workplace hazards, assess risks, and recommend preventive measures 12. The Behavior Based Safety (BBS) application gathers data on employee behavior to promote safer practices and build a culture of safety 12. Additionally, the Accidents and Safety Reporting application provides a central location for recording incidents, initiating investigations, and specifying mitigation actions 12.

Risk Management is another key area where ETQ Reliance QMS contributes to ESG reporting. The platform offers applications for risk identification and the development of mitigation plans, applicable to both environmental and social risks 7. This allows organizations to identify and control risks that may affect their operations and sustainability goals 9.

Compliance Tracking features within ETQ Reliance QMS are essential for adhering to ESG-related regulations and standards. The system provides an audit trail and facilitates regulatory updates, ensuring consistent compliance 7. Its document control capabilities are crucial for managing documentation related to environmental and social policies and procedures, ensuring that all controlled documents are created, distributed, and archived effectively 7.

Reporting & Analytics functionalities enable the analysis and presentation of ESG data. The platform offers KPI dashboards and advanced analytics to help identify trends, improve quality, and enhance financial performance in manufacturing 7. Users can leverage operational dashboards to eliminate overlapping quality issues and accelerate resolution 9.

The interconnected nature of the platform, with linking and data inheritance across applications, ensures data consistency, which is vital for accurate ESG reporting 8. Its adaptability allows businesses to configure the system to their unique needs, and integration capabilities facilitate connection with other business systems like PLM, ERP, and CRM 8.

**Pricing Models and Available Subscription Plans**

ETQ Reliance QMS operates on a subscription-based pricing model 13. While some sources mention a starting price of around $25,000 per year, the actual cost is contingent on several factors, including the number of concurrent users, the specific application sets required, and the implementation approach (configured, out-of-the-box, or a mix) 13. The platform does not offer transparent, tiered pricing, necessitating direct engagement with the vendor to obtain a personalized quote 17. While a free version is mentioned in one instance, this is likely inaccurate for an enterprise-grade QMS 13. Similarly, the availability of a free trial is uncertain, with some sources indicating it is not available 13. This lack of public pricing details is common for enterprise software solutions, where costs are often tailored to the specific scope and scale of the deployment.

**User Reviews and Testimonials on ESG Reporting**

User reviews for ETQ Reliance QMS primarily focus on its core quality management and EHS functionalities, with limited specific feedback on its ESG reporting capabilities 18. Users often praise its document management features, audit trail capabilities, and overall support for compliance, all of which indirectly contribute to effective ESG reporting 19. One user noted the platform's ability to support all ISO management system needs, including environmental standards like ISO 14001 20. However, some users have found the reporting features to be complex and difficult to use 19. The general sentiment in reviews suggests that while ETQ Reliance QMS provides a robust platform for quality and safety management, its explicit use and recognition as a dedicated ESG reporting tool are not prominently featured in user feedback. Organizations considering ETQ Reliance QMS specifically for ESG reporting should seek targeted information from the vendor to ascertain the depth and usability of its features in this domain.

This includes straightforward dashboards and configurable reports that simplify social reporting by providing insights into workforce composition, diversity metrics (by race, age, etc.), and workforce investment, including compensation 22. This leverages Workday's strong foundation in human capital management.

Workday also provides preconfigured ESG solutions that enable organizations to establish an emissions baseline and assurance-ready greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, set science-based emissions targets, identify the marginal abatement cost of emissions abatement options, adopt an emissions abatement strategy, and manage emissions budgets 4. These pre-built solutions can streamline the implementation process for ESG reporting.

The platform boasts robust integration capabilities, allowing it to connect to data from various enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management (HCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and other transactional systems through a built-in integration framework 4.
